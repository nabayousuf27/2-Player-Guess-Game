## 🚀 How to Play  

1️⃣ **User 1 starts**:  
   - They guess a number within the given range.  
   - A random number is generated within that range.  
   - If they guess correctly, they win! Otherwise, they retry in the next round.  

2️⃣ **User 2’s turn**:  
   - They follow the same process.  

3️⃣ **Winner is determined**:  
   - The player with fewer attempts **wins**!  
   - If both take the same number of attempts, it's a **tie**.
